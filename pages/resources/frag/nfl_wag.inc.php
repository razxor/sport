<h2>NFL wagering: Best game in town</h2>
<p>Here's why pro football offers the best wagering opportunity:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Possibility of high returns with relatively low risk. Football wagering allows returns that are as high as other casino games with much less risk. Whereas even the stock market typically offers plus or minus 10% return per year with a high degree of risk, football wagering offers up to a 400% return per season, if wagering the same amount each week. Our worst season over the past 6 years, 58%, still resulted in a 100% return on the average amount wagered per week while the 69% rate we experienced last season resulted in 400%. Not bad for just watching television.</li>
	<li>Easy bankroll preservation. Football wagering is safer than other casino games which typically carry an inherent risk of total loss. If a correct money management system is used, the worst scenario over the course of a football season is simply breaking even.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Complete access to information. The transparency of the market (ie. the games) and the complete accessibility of information (ie. every possible statistic) allows us to employ our unique analysis which has successfully predicted the past 6 seasons. NFL teams do not self-report statistics nor do games take place behind closed doors to the advantage of insiders. Compare this to horse racing where insiders have access to critical information not available to the public.</li>
	<li>Low commission. Since the odds typically offered are 10 to 11 (ie. wager $11 to win $10), the break/even percentage is 52.4% representing a reasonable 4.8% commission to the sports book for making the market and half that at our recommended sports book. Compare this to horse racing where the commission is typically 20% or more.</li>
	<li>Fun factor. Wagering on pro football is fun and easy unlike many casino games. While poker or blackjack require long tedious hours of play, football wagering involves just watching the game or checking the result.</li>
