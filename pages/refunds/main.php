<p>There is a no refund of any purchase of picks on <?=$maind?>. Unlike physical goods, electronically distributed information can be easily consumed or copied. Accordingly, it is our policy that once we have provided the picks to a customer, the sale is final, and the customer may not return information for a refund or credit. Refunds will not be provided due to poor predictive performance. We realize that extenuating circumstances may occur and will honor requests for a refund for download issues when it is due to server or other technical issues.

<h2>Requests for Refund from fraud</h2>
<p>Requests for refund due to unauthorized transactions or other fraudulent use of a credit/debit card on <?=$maind?> will be considered on a case by case basis. As a courtesy, we will work with your credit card company and investigate any claims of fraudulent transactions. If determined that such transaction(s) were most likely made fraudulently using your credit/debit card, we will refund all transactions immediately. In some cases, we may request proof that steps have been taken to prevent such fraudulent activity in the future, such as but not limited to, closing of credit/debit card account used in the fraudulent transaction(s) or issuance of a new credit/debit card by your card provider.
<p>In all cases where claims of fraudulent transactions are received, the <?=$maind?> account(s) used to make purchase will be frozen indefinitely, and steps may be taken to prevent new accounts to be opened using same user info or attempts to make additional purchases with same credit/debit card.
<p>If you have any further questions about our Refund Policy you can always contact us by email at <?=$contact_info['email']?>. We are always willing to work with our customers so if you feel you are entitled to a refund for whatever reason please reach out to us.</p>
